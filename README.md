We will study Tesla stock price and revenues using web scraping, the library `yfinance`, making an Exploratory Data Analysis with interactive plotes, and using different machine learning models (logistic regression, XGBClassifier,...). A Recursive Neural Network is then deployed to make predictions. 

## What's in here?
Here you can find:
- The notebook `Tesla_stock_price_analysis.ipynb` with the web scraping part, the interactive plots, the Exploratory Data Analysis and the Machine Learning models,
- The notebook `Tesla_stock_price_prediction.ipynb` with a Recursive Neural Network to carry out the prediction task.
- A csv file with some data `TSLA.csv`.

## Dataset
We got our data using the library `yfinance` and web-scraping. For simplicity we've also uploaded the data in csv format.
